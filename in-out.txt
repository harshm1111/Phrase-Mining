Clustering and classification are important problems in machine learning.
There are many machine learning algorithms for classification and clustering problems.
Classification problems require training data.
Most clustering problems require user-specified group number.
SVM, LogisticRegression and NaiveBayes are machine learning algorithms for classification problems.
k-means, AGNES and DBSCAN are clustering algorithms.
Dimension reduction methods such as PCA are also learning algorithms for clustering problems.
